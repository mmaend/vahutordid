Creation of my first website where the following need to be implemented:

1.Management panel for the super admin account where: 

a. The super admin can login and inspect all the products that are on sale along with the sales that are done for any given period [day(s), week(s), month(s), year(s)] 

b. The super admin will be able to decide which product from which member of the cooperation goes live (can be bought) and at what price 

c. The super admin will be able to share the money earned from the sales of each product. Required to insert to the database the aforementioned products to a proper table. Also, required to update the database to be able to accommodate the following:

2.Management Panel of Members, super admin, and members of the cooperation.

3.Client Panel for the Clients, holds the people that register and login to the e-shop in order to buy the products. The clients need to be registered first before they can buy a product.

4.Management Panel of Transactions, it holds all the transactions between the members and the super admin account and hold also all the buys from the Clients.

5.Management Panel of the Cart, is used as an intermediate space where a client can put to his cart the items that wish to buy. The items on the cart must be retained between logins and must be removed when the client removes them or upon successful buy to the e-shop.

6.Management Panel of the Wishlist, this is a list for each client that wishes to alert the e-shop that wishes to buy a certain product when it is available.
